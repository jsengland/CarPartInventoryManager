# CarPartInventoryManager

### Description
This program will act as a user interface for a user to interact with an inventory of parts, customers, and customer orders differently based on the role they select. The user will be able to create orders, remove orders, modify orders, update stock in the inventory, add a new part to the inventory, mark orders as shipped, and print out all current data in the system.
